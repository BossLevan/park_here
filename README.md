# ParkHere
Airbnb for parking spaces in Africa. 

# Description
The main aim of our project is to allow home owners to monetize their unused compound(property) space by offering people in areas with limited parking spaces a space to park their vehicles for a fee. 

We realized that when people attend events in Africa(Nigeria), there are usually few parking spaces in/around the event centeres and those tend to get occupied very quickly, forcing other attendees to drive long distances to find spaces to park. This is usually very inconviencing because these people eventually have to trek all the way back to the event centers. Furthermpre, those vehicles parked far away are more suspectible to security risks. 

This is why we have built this project. ParkHere offers a safe, proximal solution to users looking for a space to park.  

# How it works
As a driver all you need is a [ParkHere Account](http://parkhere.com/signup). Once that is set up you can just [login](http://parkhere.com/signin). After logging in, you will be shown the nearest parking spaces(house compounds) within a 1km radius of your current location, and you will have the opportunity to book the space and be billed based on the amount of time your car remains parked. 

# Technology
The platform is availble as a webservice built in __Nodejs__. Google Maps API services where used to power the geo-location capabilities.
